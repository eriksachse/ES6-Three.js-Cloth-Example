# Three Seed -> https://github.com/edwinwebb/three-seed.git

Three.js starter project boilerplate bundled with Webpack.

This project is designed to help you get started on your next three.js project. It sets up a simple scene, camera and renderer to view two imported GLTF assets.

[Online Demo](http://edwinwebb.github.io/three-seed/)

### Install with Git

In terminal clone the project into a directory of your choice then delete the git folder to start fresh.

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/edwinwebb/three-seed.git my-project
cd my-project
rm -rf .git
npm install
```

## Running the development server

To see the changes you make to the starter project go to the project folder in terminal and type...

```bash
npm start
```

This command will bundle the project code and start a development server at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). Visit this in your web browser; you should see a rotating island and flower.
